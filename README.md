# ANONS

### TODO list
1. packet handling
2. better name handling for a user (keep name + don't get the name of a left user | solution: global counter of total users (unique maybe))
3. sending client information (name, current user list/count)
4. saving messages
5. retrieving last X messages (or by time)
6. saving users (mac address)
